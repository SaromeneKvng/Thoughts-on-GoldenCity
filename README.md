Initial thoughts after reviewing the document



GoldenCity presents an exciting opportunity to bridge traditional real estate investment with blockchain technology. I took the time to onboard on Arrived.com and the comparison makes the direction clear. Blending traditional real estate investing with crypto payments feels like a sensible approach, especially for a crypto-native audience.

A few high-level thoughts and questions:

- The most critical design decision is who we're designing for? GoldenCity sits at the crossline of two distinct user groups, It might help to clearly define the core user early, for example crypto-native investors vs traditional investors open to crypto. That decision affects almost every UX choice.


- The value proposition would benefit from sharper prioritisation.


- The 3D property visualisation stands out, but I’d want to clarify how this is expected to be handled. Would the 3D assets be provided by the team or an external partner, or is the expectation that they’re designed from scratch by a 3D designer?  This impacts scope, timelines, and how tightly the experience can be integrated into the product, especially if Three.js is involved.


- What's the primary business model? (Platform fees, transaction fees, management fees?)


- Do we have any existing user data or research for the project?


- The investment guide is a good idea. I’d explore turning this into a guided, step-by-step flow that connects directly to the investment process.


- Given this involves money and crypto, trust signals will be critical. I didn’t see much around compliance, security, or explaining how crypto transactions are handled. Even simple explanations or reassurance could go a long way.


- The blog makes sense for SEO, but it could also help educate users who are less familiar with crypto-based property investing.


Final thoughts

GoldenCity has the potential to make real estate investment accessible to more people while leading the way in integrating crypto into a traditionally cautious market. The design challenge lies in simplifying complex technology, establishing trust in a new platform, and catering to users with varying levels of technical experience.
